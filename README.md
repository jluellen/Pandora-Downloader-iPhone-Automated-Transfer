# Pandora-Downloader-iPhone-Automated-Transfer
This program allows anyone who has a jailbroken iPhone and Pandora Downloader to quickly and easily transfer their songs from your phone to your computer.

As a constant user of Pandora Downloader, I always found it irritating everytime I went to transfer songs off of my phone and onto my computer and import them into iTunes. So, I decided to automate it. All you have to do is: have you computer connected via hotspot or have both devices on the same network (typically a wireless network). Make sure you meet all the requirements below and the rest is easy. Download my Python file, open terminal, navigate to where the script resides, and run the script. Everything from there is easy, if you're connected via hotspot you don't even need to know the ip adress of your iPhone, my script automatically obtains it. However, if you're connected via wifi, you'll need to know the ip address and enter it when prompted. Don't worry if you accidently enter the address wrong, you'll be automatically prompted to reenter the ip address if it's incorrect.
